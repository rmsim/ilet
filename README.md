To analyze video files, run ```ensemble.py```, making sure to change ```video_filename``` and ```audio_filename```. The file will split the video into natural segments as well as classify each one as a clap, music, or speech.

You may need to change ```low,high``` (the number of segments to split the video into) to get the proper classification analysis. Hopefully, we will think of a way to code this in!
